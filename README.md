##  About Me

I am based in San Diego, CA and have been here for over 20 years.

I am currently a Data Engineer at Dexcom as part of the manufacturing data analytics team. I have been a part of the Dexcom team since 2020 and have loved being part of an amazing organization.

I have graduated from the University of San Diego with a BS/BA in Industrial and Systems Engineering. I have a passion for programming and using it to automate data collection and data analysis. I believe the future involves automating simple tasks to allow other people to reach their greater potential. 

In my free time, I love to long board and spend time with family and friends.
